# Who I Am: Sami Rautanen
## AI Developer & System Architect (2026)

### **Overview**
I'm an **AI Developer** specializing in **Context Engineering**, **Agentic AI Architecture**, and **Production AI Systems**. I work at the intersection of AI agent development, application architecture, and interactive experiences. 

My approach is high-level orchestration: designing how AI agents collaborate, communicate, and solve problems — rather than getting lost in low-level code. I build AI systems that ship.

With experience in multi-agent frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen) and a background in game development and 3D design, I bridge the gap between AI-literate engineers and traditional developers.

### **What I Do**

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **AI Agent Developer** | I build autonomous agents that reason, plan, and execute tasks |
| **AI-Assisted Developer** | I use AI tools to accelerate development and solve complex problems |
| **System Architect** | I design how AI components interact with applications and users |

### **My Evolution**

```
2020-2023: Coder → Writing code, learning syntax, tutorials
2023-2024: Programmer → Building full applications, shipping projects
2024-2026: AI Developer → Orchestrating AI systems, high-level architecture
```

I've evolved from writing code line-by-line to designing systems where AI agents handle the implementation while I focus on **what** needs to happen, not **how** to code it.

---

### **About Me**
I'm based in Finland and available for remote projects worldwide. When I'm not building AI agents or architecting systems, I create indie games and 3D art—you can check out my game projects on itch.io and my 3D work on ArtStation. I'm passionate about the intersection of AI and interactive experiences, which is why I combine my background in technical design with modern AI development.

### **My Education & Background**
* **Vocational Qualification in Technical Design:** Hyria Ammattiopisto (3D Visualization & Structural Design)
* **Gaming Code Course (C#):** Taitotalo Helsinki (2023, 1 year, team-based game development)
* **Professional Experience:** 3D/2D Artist & Coder at indie game studio (several years)
* **Self-taught:** AI agent development, web frameworks, multi-agent orchestration
* **Continuous Learning:** Agentic AI Engineering (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, MCP)

**Team Experience:**
- Worked in indie game studio teams (graphics + coders collaboration)
- Taitotalo team projects (e.g., "Heaven & Hell" game on my Itch.io)
- Collaborative development with version control and agile workflows
