## 2. About (Summary)

I am an **AI Developer** and **Technical Designer** who bridges the gap between creative vision and technical implementation.

My journey began in structural design, giving me a disciplined foundation in systems thinking and visualization. Today, I apply that architectural mindset to software. I don't just write code—I **orchestrate intelligent systems**.

I specialize in **Agentic AI**, designing multi-agent architectures (using frameworks like CrewAI, LangGraph, and AutoGen) that solve complex problems autonomously. I also bring deep expertise in **Game Engines** (Unity/Unreal), combining logic with high-fidelity visualization.

**Core Focus Areas:**
*   **🤖 AI Agent Development:** Building autonomous agents that interact with tools and APIs.
*   **🧠 Context Engineering:** Architecting how systems efficiently process and retain information.
*   **🎮 Game Engine Expertise:** Developing complex interactive systems and mechanics in Unity & Unreal Engine.
*   **🚀 Full-Stack Production:** Shipping robust applications with Next.js, Python, and TypeScript.

I am currently open to roles in **Technical Architecture**, **AI Integration**, and **Full-Stack Development** where I can apply forward-thinking AI strategies to solve real-world problems.

## 6. Profile Photo Strategy
**Target Vibe:** "The Technical Creative"
*   **Goal:** Signal that you built the Game/AI systems, not just played them.
*   **Attire:**
    *   *Option A (The Pivot):* High-quality **crewneck sweater** or **textured t-shirt** (Dark Grey, Navy, or Black). Fits the "Architect" persona perfectly.
    *   *Option B (The Authentic):* A **premium solid-color hoodie** (no logos, clean structure). If you wear a hoodie, ensure the lighting is studio-quality to keep it professional.
*   **Lighting:** Soft side lighting (window light). Avoid dark/grainy webcams.
*   **Method:** Use **Secta.ai** or **Aragon.ai** to generate professional results from your existing photos. Select the "Casual" or "Tech" packs.
