## 2. About (Summary)

I'm an **AI Developer** and **Technical Designer** who bridges the gap between creative vision and technical implementation.

My journey began in structural design, giving me a disciplined foundation in systems thinking and visualization. Today, I apply that architectural mindset to software. I don't just write code—I **orchestrate intelligent systems**.

I specialize in **Agentic AI**, designing multi-agent architectures (using frameworks like CrewAI, LangGraph, and AutoGen) that solve complex problems autonomously. I also bring deep expertise in **Game Engines** (Unity/Unreal), combining logic with high-fidelity visualization.

**My Core Focus Areas:**
*   **🤖 AI Agent Development:** Building autonomous agents that interact with tools and APIs
*   **🧠 Context Engineering:** Architecting how systems efficiently process and retain information
*   **🎮 Game Engine Expertise:** Developing complex interactive systems and mechanics in Unity & Unreal Engine
*   **🚀 Full-Stack Production:** Shipping robust applications with Next.js, Python, and TypeScript

I'm currently open to roles in **Technical Architecture**, **AI Integration**, and **Full-Stack Development** where I can apply forward-thinking AI strategies to solve real-world problems.
